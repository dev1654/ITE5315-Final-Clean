The bed is full size. 2. No smoking on the premises.  3. No loud music or TV etc.  4. Only for one person (no couples, no visitors). We seldom have visitors, let alone overnight guests. We know this will be a major turn-off to many people, but we believe we can find a like-minded roommate who can have fun outside the house.  5. If you are not sure about your check-out date, you can reserve the minimum days and extend your stay at a discounted rate.  6. Check-in time has to be coordinated at least 48 hours ahead. On arrival, a short registration process with a picture ID is needed in exchange for keys and wifi access.  7. Inside the apartment, we take off our outside shoes.

You know, keeping it quiet, clean and pleasant to you and all else! **The kitchen is fully equipped with top of the line items, but please maintain it a vegetarian kitchen if you choose to cook, so that our kosher friends can enjoy the apartment as well. You may bring in non-vegetarian takeout from Wholefoods or one of the great restaurants around, we will have plenty of plastic/paper utensils and plates for your convenience. **Absolutely NO SMOKING, of any kind, in the apartment or the building's stoop. There is a garden with benches a few buildings down if you must have a smoke.","license":"","property_type":"bungalow","thumbnail":"https://picsum.photos/seed/1549218/400/300","images":["https://picsum.photos/seed/1549218a/600/400","https://picsum.photos/seed/1549218b/600/400","https://picsum.photos/seed/1549218c/600/400"]},{"id":"1549770","NAME":"Bright Brooklyn Flat w/Park Views, 30 day minimum","host id":"64559081683","host_identity_verified":"unconfirmed","host name":"Miller","neighbourhood group":"Brooklyn","neighbourhood":"Prospect-Lefferts Gardens","lat":"40.66009","long":"-73.96237","country":"United States","country code":"US","instant_bookable":"FALSE","cancellation_policy":"moderate","room type":"Entire home/apt","Construction year":"2011","price":"$372 ","service fee":"$74 ","minimum nights":"30","number of reviews":"32","last review":"10/11/2016","reviews per month":"0.37","review rate number":"1","calculated host listings count":"1","availability 365":"312","house_rules":"No smoking, no very late nights, no pets or and crooks allowed.
