The bed is full size. 2. No smoking on the premises.  3. No loud music or TV etc.  4. Only for one person (no couples, no visitors). We seldom have visitors, let alone overnight guests. We know this will be a major turn-off to many people, but we believe we can find a like-minded roommate who can have fun outside the house.  5. If you are not sure about your check-out date, you can reserve the minimum days and extend your stay at a discounted rate.  6. Check-in time has to be coordinated at least 48 hours ahead. On arrival, a short registration process with a picture ID is needed in exchange for keys and wifi access.  7. Inside the apartment, we take off our outside shoes.

However we request that our guests leave the dishes, glassware and cooking utensils clean for the next guests. It is not acceptable to put dirty dishes back into the cabinets. I am very generous when I review guests. I don't believe any have gotten less than five stars. We have never had a guest we could not honestly recommend to another host! Please do not put baby wipes, diapers, paper towels, feminine products, etc. into the toilet. We are on a city sewer system over which the city planted trees.
